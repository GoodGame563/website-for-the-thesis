# Thesis Web Site (Thesis)

This repository contains the web interface for the thesis project: "Development of an analytics system for marketplace product grids using neural network technologies for automation and acceleration of assortment analysis".

## Purpose & Architecture

The `site` directory provides a Next.js-based frontend for user interaction, analysis requests, and result visualization. It connects to the API gateway and displays analytics generated by the AI service.

### Main Components
- `pages/`: Routing and main pages (login, register, requests, users)
- `components/`: UI components (AccountModal, AnalysisForm, Carousel, etc.)
- `utils/`: API client, token manager, error handler
- `styles/`: CSS modules and global styles
- `public/`: Static assets (images, etc)
- `package.json`: Project dependencies
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration

## Workflow
1. User registers and logs in (JWT auth)
2. Submits analysis requests via forms
3. Receives and visualizes results (product analytics, images, reviews)
4. Manages account, history, and subscriptions
5. Handles authentication, session management, and API integration

## Features
- User authentication and registration
- Product analysis request forms
- Result visualization (carousel, overlays)
- Account and subscription management
- Responsive design (Tailwind CSS)
- Integration with API gateway
- Error handling and notification system

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Docker for containerization

## Environment Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
2. Build and run locally:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build and run with Docker:
   ```powershell
   docker build -t thesis-site .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 thesis-site
   ```

## Configuration
- All API endpoints and credentials should be configured in the code or environment as needed.
- The site runs on port 3000 by default.

## Integration
- Communicates with API gateway via REST endpoints
- Handles JWT tokens for session management
- All API calls managed via `ApiClient.js`

## Development Notes
- Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- See thesis for UI/UX and workflow diagrams
